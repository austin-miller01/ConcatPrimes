Getting Started
===============

This program will give you 5 numbers apart of a list of concatenated primes. The slice of 5 concatenated primes will start based on what was entered for the integer n. For example, if n was 3 the list of 5 primes would start 3 characters from the beginning of the list of concatenated primes.

Installation and RUN

1.) Type "make" into terminal to run everything in the make file which will compile the 
program making an executable, it will test the arguments, and it will make the Doxyfile.
2.) To then run the program after "make" is successful, enter "./bin/concat" to run the program.
3.) To exit the program enter an incorrect number or character for n.
If you want to uses aspects of the makefile individually here are some commands you can use.
1.) "make doc" in terminal will create documentation (see Documentation for more information)
2.) "make concat" will compile the program allowing you to run it.
3.) "make test" will test the arguments of the program making sure there are no errors.
4.) "make clean" will clear the ./bin and ./doc folders of any file they might have.

Documentation
=============

1.) "make doc" from terminal this will create the documentation for this project
2.) Go to Doc/Html and open up the file index.html from a browser
